# [Servlets and JSP](Servlets_demo)
### Brief introduction to it:
 - A **servlet** is a Java class which is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response model. Servlets are mainly used to extend the applications hosted by webs servers, however, they can respond to other types of requests too. For such applications, HTTP-specific servlet classes are defined by Java Servlet technology.
 - A **JSP** is a text document which contains two types of text: static data and dynamic data. The static data can be expressed in any text-based format (like HTML, XML, SVG and WML), and the dynamic content can be expressed by JSP elements.
