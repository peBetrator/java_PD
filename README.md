# [Data Structure Problems](DataStructure)
1. Create a Maven project which implements stack data structure for Java type char, based on Java array. Implementation should contains push,  pop, peek, size, isEmpty functionality.
2. Add Junit dependencies on project and write unit tests for stack implementation.
3. Based on created stack create a program which reverse a  String, i.e input:desserts, output: stressed
4. Based on created stack write a program that checks the delimiters in a line of text read from file. The delimiters are the braces '{' and '}', brackets '[' and ']', and parentheses '(' and ')'. Each opening or left delimiter should be matched by a closing or right delimiter; that is, every '{' should be followed by a matching '}' and so on. Also, opening delimiters that occur later in the string should be closed before those occurring earlier. 

Examples:

 - c[d] // correct
 - a{b[c]d}e // correcta
 - {b(c]d}e // not correct; ] doesn't match
 - (a[b{c}d]e} // not correct; nothing matches final }
  - a{b(c) // not correct; Nothing matches opening {
  
Additional improvement:

Refactor implemented stack in order to be able to operate with generic data type <T>

# [Servlets and JSP](Servlets_demo)
### Brief introduction to it:
 - A **servlet** is a Java class which is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response model. Servlets are mainly used to extend the applications hosted by webs servers, however, they can respond to other types of requests too. For such applications, HTTP-specific servlet classes are defined by Java Servlet technology.
 - A **JSP** is a text document which contains two types of text: static data and dynamic data. The static data can be expressed in any text-based format (like HTML, XML, SVG and WML), and the dynamic content can be expressed by JSP elements.

### My Scopes
 - To create dynamic webapp which is going to cover Login/Register scenarios
